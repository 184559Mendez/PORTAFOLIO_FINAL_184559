    <p>And everybody know the story of David and Goliath<br> 
        But this is bigger than triumph<br>
        This is for the warrior, this is for you and I<br>
        This is for euphoria, give me a piece of mind<br>
        God is recording this, won't you look in the sky?<br>
        Tell him you got the behavior of your neighbor<br>
        Even when stability's never in your favor<br>
        Fly with the turbulence, only last a minute<br>
        Land on your dreams, and recognize you live it</p>

    <p>Walk through the valley of peace, with bare feet (Oh)<br>
        Run through the flames, that's more passion for me (Oh)<br>
        I passed testimony just so the world can see (Oh)<br>
        Battle wounds on me, you watching me lick 'em clean<br>
        I know, I know, my pride, my goals, my highs, my lows<br>
        I know, I know, it's mind control<br>
        I know I could prosper, no impostor, prosecute my posture<br>
        I stand up and I stand by ya, what?</p>
    
    <p>I am a freedom fighter, the name that history wrote<br>
        And even through disaster, eye of the tiger for hope<br>
        I'm tryna find my way back, there's no day off for heroes<br>
        And even when I'm tired, go is the only word I know</p>
    
    <p>And the night is takin' over, and the moonlight gets exposure<br>
        And the players have been chosen<br>
        And it seems like fate has spoken<br>
        When it seems your faith has broken, by the second, losin' focus<br>
        Ain't no way to get off, get off, get off, get off<br>
        Unless you move forward</p>
        
    <p>I bet they wonder how I go on, go on<br>
        I bet they wonder how I go on, go on<br>
        I'll simply say, "It's on again, it's on again", whoa-oh<br>
        The world don't stop, it's on again, it's on again, whoa-oh</p>
    
    <p>I am a lonely hero, trying to fight my battles<br>
        Life likes to blow the cold wind, sometimes it freezes my shadow<br>
        In the midst of all this darkness, I sacrifice my ego<br>
        There ain't no room for selfish, we do it for the people</p>

    <p>And the night is takin' over, and the moonlight gets exposure<br>
        And the players have been chosen<br>
        And it seems like fate has spoken<br>
        When it seems your faith has broken, by the second, losin' focus<br>
        Ain't no way to get off, get off, get off, get off<br>
        Unless you move forward</p>
    
    <p>I bet they wonder how I go on, go on<br>
        I bet they wonder how I go on, go on<br>
        I'll simply say, "It's on again, it's on again", whoa-oh<br>
        The world don't stop, it's on again, it's on again, whoa-oh</p>

    <p>Say the work don't stop, 'cause they don't stop<br>
        And everybody here tryna get on top<br>
        Everybody from the burbs down to the block<br>
        Gotta hold on tight and don't let go, let go<br>
        Huh, so you think you hot?<br>
        Gotta grind hard, give it all you got<br>
        You can have, or you can have not<br>
        You see that a lot in the ghetto, ghetto</p>

    <p>I bet they wonder how I go on, go on<br>
        I bet they wonder how I go on, go on</p>

    <p>I'll simply say, "It's on again, it's on again", whoa-oh<br>
        The world don't stop, it's on again, it's on again, whoa-oh</p>
